Classify Waste Products Using Transfer Learning
Introduction

This project is part of the IBM AI engineer specialization, in this case about deep learning(CNN and Transfer learning). EcoClean currently lacks an efficient and scalable method to automate the waste sorting process. Manual sorting of waste is labor-intensive and prone to errors, which can lead to contamination of recyclable materials. This project leverages deep learning and computer vision to automate the classification of waste products, improving efficiency and reducing contamination rates.

The project uses transfer learning with a pre-trained VGG16 model to classify images into recyclable and organic waste categories. By reusing knowledge from a model trained on ImageNet, the system can achieve high accuracy even with a limited dataset of waste images.

Aim of the Project

The aim of this IBM Deep Learning project is to develop an automated waste classification model that can differentiate between recyclable and organic waste based on images. The final goal is to provide a reliable tool that can be integrated into real-world waste management systems to reduce manual labor and minimize contamination.

Final Output: A trained and evaluated model that can classify waste images into recyclable and organic categories.

Objectives

Train a transfer learning model using a pre-trained VGG16 convolutional base.

Build a classifier on top of the convolutional features to distinguish between recyclable and organic waste.

Fine-tune the model by unfreezing deeper layers to improve accuracy on the specific waste dataset.

Visualize model performance through accuracy and loss curves for both training and validation sets.

Test the model on new images to evaluate its real-world performance and visualize predictions.

Project Workflow

Data Preparation: Images of recyclable and organic waste are loaded and preprocessed.

Feature Extraction: The convolutional base of VGG16 is used to extract high-level image features.

Classifier Training: A dense classifier is trained on top of these features to distinguish between waste types.

Fine-Tuning: The deepest layers of VGG16 are unfrozen to fine-tune the model for improved performance.

Evaluation: Both the feature-extraction model and the fine-tuned model are evaluated on test data.

Visualization: Test images are plotted with actual and predicted labels to assess model predictions visually.

Results

The Extract Features Model achieves reasonable accuracy by leveraging pre-trained features and training only the classifier.

The Fine-Tuned Model improves performance by allowing selective layers of VGG16 to adapt to the waste dataset.

Visualizations demonstrate the modelâ€™s predictions on individual images, highlighting successes and possible misclassifications.

Conclusion

This IBM Deep Learning project demonstrates the power of transfer learning for image classification tasks with limited datasets. By combining pre-trained convolutional features with a custom classifier and fine-tuning, it is possible to create a robust model for waste sorting. The methodology can be applied to other image classification tasks requiring high accuracy without extensive dataset requirements.
